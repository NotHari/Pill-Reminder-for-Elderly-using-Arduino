## About the Application

Pill Reminder for Elderly using Arduino reduces human effort by automating the process of reminding elderly to take their medicines at regular intervals of time.

This Arduino-based project has a wide range of applications and can be utilised by bedridden patients at home, physicians at hospitals, etc.

This project features the following features:- 

- Displaying Information like time on a Screen
- Buzzer that rings at set intervals
- LED light that lights up at set intervals
- Buttons to set number of alarms in a given day ranging from 1 to 3 alarms a day

The simulation has been done on Tinkercad, the link to which can we found [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0bJ8tCCZUKa-review2/editel)

## Components Used

The components used in Tinkercad are as follows:-

| S.no. | Component Name   | Image                                                                                                        |

## Future Work

The following areas could be improved upon in the future:- 
- The project could make use of an RTC (Real-time clock) module for accurate time readings.
- Additionally, a feature to set alarms at user-defined time could also be added.
